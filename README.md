# Capstone-clouddevops
 
 In this capstone project, I used project-ml-microservice-kubernetes from the last Udacity project to deploy it in this infrastructure

 I used Circle CI for integration purpose and was able to connect the same with Git Hub

 Screenshots shows
 1. Circle CI Success - success stage for all jobs
